# Deep Learning Pothole Detection Using YOLO

## Introduction

This project focuses on the detection of potholes on Indian roads using a deep learning approach with the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The motivation for this project stems from the increasing rate of road accidents in India due to potholes, and the need for a cost-effective and automated identification system for these road defects.

## About the Dataset

The dataset comprises 1500 images captured from various Indian roads, including cities like Coimbatore and Idukki. These images were taken under different lighting conditions, angles, distances, and weather conditions to ensure a comprehensive dataset. All images were resized to 1024x768 for uniformity.

## Methodology

### YOLO Algorithm

We utilized various versions of the YOLO algorithm, including YOLOv2, YOLOv3, and YOLOv3-tiny. The YOLO framework is well-suited for real-time applications and offers significant speed gains compared to traditional region-based CNNs.

### Data Preprocessing and Training

Images in the dataset were annotated using the LabelImg tool in YOLO format. The training process involved:

- Splitting the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
- Utilizing AlexeyABâ€™s Darknet neural network for pothole detection analysis.
- Training the models on different YOLO architectures and comparing the results.

## Results

The results of our experiments are summarized in terms of Mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, and recall. We observed that the tiny-YOLOv3 model performed the best in terms of mAP.

## Conclusion

Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of using YOLO-based deep learning models for the detection of potholes. The project offers a promising approach to enhance road safety and maintenance.
